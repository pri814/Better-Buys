These masks can be used in conjunction with other therapeutic treatments, offering localized benefits through the skin. The integration of cannabis into therapeutic masks is appealing due to its potential to enhance the efficacy of pain management and reduce discomfort associated with various health issues. As research continues to delve into the full spectrum of benefits offered by cannabis, the therapeutic market for these masks is expected to grow.
